  patientInfo: {                    // Anonymous patient data
    age?: number;
    gender?: string;
    medicalHistory?: string[];
    currentMedications?: string[];
  };
  diagnosis: string;                // Final diagnosis
  treatment: string;                // Treatment plan
  images: string[];                 // Optional medical images
  tags: string[];                   // Categorization tags
  difficulty: 'beginner'|'intermediate'|'advanced';
  specialization: string;           // Medical specialty
  doctor: ObjectId;                 // Doctor who created it
  comments: IComment[];             // Discussion comments
  likes: ObjectId[];                // Users who liked it
  isActive: boolean;                // Soft deletion flag
  createdAt: Date;

## 🎯 Use Case Scenarios

### 📖 Educational Scenario:
1. **Dr. Smith** posts a complex cardiology case
2. **Medical interns** read the case and symptoms
3. **Students** discuss possible diagnoses in comments
4. **Dr. Smith** provides additional insights
5. **Popular cases** get liked and shared more

### 🏥 Medical Training:
1. Cases organized by **specialty** (Cardiology, Neurology, etc.)
2. **Difficulty levels** for progressive learning
3. **Real patient scenarios** (anonymized) for practical experience
4. **Interactive discussions** simulate medical consultations
